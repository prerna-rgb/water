    <h1 style="text-align:center;" >80% of the water pollution is caused due to domestic sewage.</h1>    
    <img src="https://www.fairplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/water-pollution-1200x630.1575999325.jpg" width="930" height="450">

	Humans are the main cause of water pollution, which is triggered in many ways: by the dumping of industrial waste; due to temperature rise, that cause the alteration of water by reducing the oxygen in its composition; Or due to deforestation, which causes sediments and bacteria to appear under the soil and therefore contaminate groundwater.
In the same way, the pesticides used in agricultural fields filter through underground channels and reach the consumption networks; And also as a result of accidental spillage of oil.
What are the main consequences of water pollution? Firstly, the disappearance of biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems. Also, humans are harmed by the alteration in the food chain and by contracting illnesses when drinking or using contaminated water. As you can see, water pollution has a great impact in the environment. 
For all this, we must ensure water availability, its sustainable management and sanitation for all, as reflected in the sixth of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda.</p>
To the average American, it’s just a natural part of our every day: whether it’s washing our dishes, taking a post-workout shower, or brushing our teeth. It all goes down the drain. Out of sight, out of mind. 

But according to the NRDC, “more than 80 percent of the world’s wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused, according to the United Nations; in some least-developed countries, the figure tops 95 percent. In the United States, wastewater treatment facilities process about 34 billion gallons of wastewater per day.”

Think that’s high? Well, it’s only as proportional as the water usage of each country, even in the U.S. As we’ve previously discussed, Americans use 300 gallons of water per day on average, per household. That’s nothing to sneeze at.

When anyone mentions the word “microplastics”, an image of a turtle or dolphin swimming in a sea of garbage is immediately conjured, bits of plastic wrapped in its flippers.

You can see instances of this across the globe. But more specifically, in an area surrounding the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). The GPGP is an island-like formation that sits in the Pacific Ocean on top of the water, entirely made up of plastic bits, and has been described as “larger than Texas”. Some of it is an amalgamation of plastic bottles and bits, but for the most part, it’s actually plastic from the fishing industry itself. According to National Geographic, “of the 79,000 metric tons of plastic in the patch, most of it is abandoned fishing gear—not plastic bottles or packaging”
