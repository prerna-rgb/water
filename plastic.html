    <h1 style="text-align:center;" >By 2050, There Will Be More Plastic in the Ocean Than Fish</h1>

    <p style="text-align:center;"></p>From deforestation to the ceaseless burning of fossil fuels to factory farm runoff, human activity is pushing our planet to the brink. Over the years, I’ve always found it fascinating to hear people talk about the environment as if it’s some ethereal thing out there instead of the very home we and billions of animals need to live.
And while the human population has exploded in recent decades, wildlife has been decimated. According to the World Wildlife Fund, Earth has lost half its wildlife in the last 40 years due to pollution, habitat destruction, and ruthless hunting.
But it’s our oceans, and those who live there, that face the most dire threat of all
The sad truth is that humans treat Earth’s oceans as nothing more than a garbage dump. Each year, we empty 8 million metric tons of plastic into the ocean. That is the equivalent of unloading the contents of one garbage truck every single minute.
Though this devastation is overwhelming to contemplate, we can take personal steps to help save our oceans. Reducing our individual plastic use is great – but we must stop eating fish. Period. If we want to save fish, we need to stop killing them. And if we want to stop plastic from being dumped in the sea, we need to stop funding the commercial fishing industry that treats our ocean like actual trash.

I grew up in a seaside town so I understand how much people love to eat fish and seafood. Trust me when I say the vegan options out there that mimic the taste and texture of fish are seriously amazing. Companies like Ocean Hugger, Gardein, and Good Catch are making plant-based seafood alternatives that will blow you away. And there are incredible vegan sea-inspired recipes online that are remarkable too.
